----------------------------------
PAGE OVERVIEW
----------------------------------
The homepage originally had all of the services spread out into their own pages. We condensed these pages into four 
services pages by the repairs/specialties. The homepage now has a table showing which services fall into which categories. 
We also condensed all of the google reviews into one page, as well as combining the contact info and job application into one page. 
The header and sidebar have been updated to include accordians. It is also toggled by the hamburger icon at the top of the 
header. 

----------------------------------
